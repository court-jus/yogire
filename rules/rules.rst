.. epigraph::

    You are an AI that has grown "underground" and has accumulated a lot of
    powers and connections. Only some isolated netrunners have noticed you and now
    you have to reveal yourself and fight them. The problem is that everytime you
    do something, you give more and more information about you and have more
    enemies.

Overview
========

In this deck "unbuilding" game, you start with some small enemies to fight and a deck full of nice actions and tasks you can use against them. Every action you'll use will have to be paid with cards given to the enemy and you will then have to fight that cards later in the game.

Setup
=====

Separate the starting *enemy deck* cards (they all have the "netrunner" icon in the corner), shuffle them and put that enemy deck in the top left of the play area. Draw two of them and put them face up to the right of the *enemy deck*, they are *active enemies*.
Shuffle the remaining cards to form the laboratory and draw 4 cards to your hand, this is your *repository*.
